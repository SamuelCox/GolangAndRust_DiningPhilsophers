# GolangAndRust_DiningPhilsophers
A repository to learn Golang and Rust through the Dining Philosophers excercise


Dining Philosophers is a exercise in parallel and concurrent programming that I did at the University of Kent.

There are 5 philosphers sat around a table, and a fork to their left, and right. There are only 5 forks in total, but each philospher requires both the left and right fork at the same time to be able to eat. The purpose of this exercise is to create a system that does not deadlock (i.e all philosophers get 1 fork and can never get the other)
